# Overview of project repository

The project can be split into 5 principal components: The description of [the project in its entirety](./project-description.md), [theme 1](./themes/week-1), [theme 2](./themes/week-2), [theme 3](./themes/week-3), and [theme 4](./themes/week-4). Note that each theme also has associated input files which (as described within the project description) students must be able to parse for each week. Their format are described in each theme.

**All the above files are machine translated from Danish to English and may contain errors**. If you are a teacher looking to navigate the project, see [here](../teachers/readme.md).
