# Teacher introduction

The project is described more in detail in the publication:

*Nicolajsen, S.M., Caspersen, M.E., Brabrand, C. Circle of Life: Microworld Project at the end of CS1. SIGCSE '25: Proceedings of the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education.*

However, due to the length limitations we refer to this document as an attempt to fill in some of the gaps. We will not be mentioning elements already explained therein, but rather provide a 'step to step' guide for execution of this project in a different class.

First you should familiarize yourself with the introductory guide found on the [front page](../) to explore the posibilities of the microworld. If you feel comfortable from here, you can devise your own project surrounding this (we also provide students with this guide as an assignment prior to start).

However, we have created four themes which each are intended to be completable by a group of three in roughly a week (wherein students each spend 15 hours working for an average result). For more information regarding the expected time consumption reach out to us (sebni@itu.dk). For some students, time will be distributed less equally across all weeks, but these are attempts at scaffolding their experience. Below we outline the typical schedule of the project as-is.

## Current project routine (given in relative weeks to start date)

- Week -1: Students receive the project description and introductory guide on the front page, and are tasked with following the introductory guide and form groups.
- Week 0: Group must be finalized, and the students receive the first [theme](./themes/week-1)
