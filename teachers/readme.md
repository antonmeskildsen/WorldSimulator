# Teacher introduction

The project is described more in detail in the publication:

*Nicolajsen, S.M., Caspersen, M.E., Brabrand, C. Circle of Life: Microworld Project at the end of CS1. SIGCSE '25: Proceedings of the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education.*

However, due to the length limitations we refer to this document as an attempt to fill in some of the gaps. We will not be mentioning elements already explained therein, but rather provide a 'step to step' guide for execution of this project in a different class.

First you should familiarize yourself with the introductory guide found on the [front page](../) to explore the posibilities of the microworld. If you feel comfortable from here, you can devise your own project surrounding this (we also provide students with this guide as an assignment prior to start).

However, we have created four themes which each are intended to be completable by a group of three in roughly a week (wherein students each spend 15 hours working for an average result). For more information regarding the expected time consumption reach out to us (sebni@itu.dk). For some students, time will be distributed less equally across all weeks, but these are attempts at scaffolding their experience. Below we outline the typical schedule of the project as-is. For more information on our project, please see the [project description and individual themes](../project/readme.md).

## Current project routine (given in relative weeks to start date)

- Week -1: Students receive the project description and introductory guide on the front page, and are tasked with following the introductory guide and form groups. 
- Week 0: Group must be finalized, and the students receive the first [theme](../project/themes/week-1/readme.md)
- Week 0: Students also have a fixed slot wherein they are able to ask their assigned superviser for support (an assigned TA).
- Week 1-4: Students at the beginning of each week receive the next theme (theme [2](../project/themes/week-2/readme.md), then [3](../project/themes/week-3/readme.md), then [4](../project/themes/week-4/readme.md)...) before which they must submit their weekly project diary as described in the [project description](../project/project-description.md) which they then receive feedback upon at the next supervision.


Thus, every week consists of 1) students handing in a project diary used as input for their supervision that week (how is it going, any issues, what to do next), 2) handout of a new weekly theme. How exactly this should be structured depends on TA availability and lecture hours, i.e., if the introduction week (wherein one should also give an introduction lecture) does not happen until Friday, perhaps one should offset these activities.

For example, we introduced the project on a Thursday, students had 4 hours in lab session to complete the introductory guide. The week after the first theme came out, and students received supervision on Tuesdays (deadline for submitting diary was then Sundays).

Beyond this we had sporadically interweaved additional options for support if needed by the students (typically 2 hours a week by a single TA, depending on availability of the TA). Further, we included a single workshop on writing these two reports which students must complete.

## The report
To us, a large part of the project was students' ability to reflect upon their program during development. Thus, as described in the project description, students had to hand in a weekly diary which contains much the same sections as the final report. These were to be kept short, and intended to describe differences between the weeks, major design decisions etc. These were primarily reviewed by the TA, and added to the final report as an appendix. The final report therefore takes the role of an overarching description of their program and project (in a more holistic way). Please see the project description for more information, or reach out to us (sebni@itu.dk).


## Evaluation
In our case, the project was only part of students grade (in combination with an oral presentation of different topics). Thus, evaluation came down to fulfillment of the individual requirements of each theme and those within the project description.


## Time consumption
As we have delegated much of the supervision during the project to TAs the workload was reduced for the instructor. Further, we implemented different reporting tools (i.e., surveys) for TAs to use as a way of reporting progress of student groups which simplified the evaluation process upon final submission by the students. However, your mileage may vary depending on how hands-on the instructor is during the project.
