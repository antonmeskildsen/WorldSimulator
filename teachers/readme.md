# Teacher introduction

The project is described more in detail in the publication:

*Nicolajsen, S.M., Caspersen, M.E., Brabrand, C. Circle of Life: Microworld Project at the end of CS1. SIGCSE '25: Proceedings of the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education.*

However, due to the length limitations we refer to this document as an attempt to fill in some of the gaps. However, we will not be mentioning elements already explained therein, but rather provide a 'step to step' guide for execution of this project in a different class.
